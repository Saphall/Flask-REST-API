# Flask-REST-API

[REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) services let us interact with the database by simply doing HTTP requests. Repo to learn how to write a REST server using the Flask.

This is often how the backend of web apps is created. Returning data is in `JSON` format and requests we are using are 
[`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT),
[`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE), 
[`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) 
and [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET).
